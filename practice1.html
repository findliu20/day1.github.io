I wonder what else do you want to know about me? How about my routine in Covid quaratine? Okay i will tell you about my daily routine. In the morning, i always pass it by sleeping because i am an night owl. Then i take the afternoon class with 3 slot until 5 pm. Oh i fogot to tell, before the class, if i have a little blank time after having lunch, i read book. I'm reading "the Unberable Lightness of Being". After finish the slot 6, i come down stair to my mom's room and continue to reading books until 6:30. Then doing house-cleaning stuff and have dinner. I started to study or doing personal stuff at 9pm then it take forever... Sometimes this routine change a little bit, the order of stuff, or the length of it, but afterall, i always try to do a little better everyday. Bye.</p>
